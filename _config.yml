description: "People say New Yorkers are mean, that we’re cold and heartless. But everywhere I go, I see moments of extreme kindness. The NY I see changes day to day, reflective of what I’m feeling inside. So if I choose to be warmth and compassion, these pockets of NY kindness come flowing out in hidden interactions. Here’s my attempt to capture and share these ‪#‎100NYmoments‬."
