description: Day 32 - all love<p>When she approached us, a black woman to a group of Asian kids, all I could do was hold her hand and say, "I love you, too." How absurd... strangers unabashedly declaring love because of the hurt and anger we feel together.</p><p>I'm not black nor Christian, but I'm American and it hurts. It hurts that in the house of God, in your sanctuary, your place of refuge... We failed you. As a nation, we failed to respect your lives.</p><p>This tragedy has been a huge mind fuck and I don't know what to do. "It is not enough to be compassionate; we must act." - His Holiness the @DalaiLama What can we do?</p>
