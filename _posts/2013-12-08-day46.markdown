description: Day 46 - one love<p>I don't remember the last verse.. But it was something cute that ended with "unite!" I gotta say, this was super sweet to see - a gathering of white senior citizens saying all the right things. At a time where we can't avoid the hateful rhetoric broadcasted in media, this felt like a big grandpa/grandma hug saying "it's going to be ok."</p>
