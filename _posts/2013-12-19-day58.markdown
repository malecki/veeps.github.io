description: Day 58 - butterfly effect<p>I love this story because (1) we see this balancing act so often that most NYers wouldn't offer to help.. We'd be like "she got this!" (2) the gesture , so simple... without any words exchanged most of us wouldn't notice and (3) because of that small gesture and because my friend noticed & told me this story, it's now made at least 3 people happy and hopefully some of you too. All of our movements, big and small, have potential to make someone's day. </p>
